# danger-js-action

A GitHub Action for running [Danger JS](https://danger.systems/js/) against pull requests.
It will comment inline with the PR and can be configured to fail the build if the Danger run fails.
It is implemented inside a Docker container to allow DangerJS to be run without adding it as
a dependency to your project if your project is implemented in NodeJS or uses a NPM compatible
package manager. This implementation also allows the action to be used in projects implemented
in any language as a result.

The Dangerfile can be stored locally or remotely. If stored remotely, it will be downloaded
over HTTP or HTTPS. This implementation expects the Dangerfile to be implemented in
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and end with the `.ts` extension.
